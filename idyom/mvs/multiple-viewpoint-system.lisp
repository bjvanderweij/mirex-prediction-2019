;;;; DESCRIPTION 
;;;;
;;;;   A multiple viewpoint system consists of a vector of viewpoint
;;;;   types and corresponding vectors containing long-term and
;;;;   short-term models models for each of those viewpoint
;;;;   types. This file contains methods for modelling sequences
;;;;   (construction and prediction) using multiple viewpoint systems.
;;;;
;;;; TODO 
;;;;
;;;;   - Should be able to select combination order:
;;;;       o Viewpoints then LTM-STM (as currently) 
;;;;       o LTM-STM then Viewpoints
;;;;       o simultaneously over all models 
;;;;
;;;;   - derived viewpoints predict over alphabet empirically derived
;;;;     from corpus, elements which do not correspond to any basic
;;;;     element are removed, basic elements which receive no prediction
;;;;     are predicted by escaping down to the order -1 model (cf
;;;;     Darrell's implementation).
;;;;
;;;;   - when predicting the value of a basic attribute using a linked
;;;;     viewpoint which has a component viewpoint which doesn't
;;;;     predict that basic attribute (e.g., (cpint dur)), assume that
;;;;     dur has already been predicted and use this to narrow down
;;;;     the elements of the derived alphabet considered.
;;;;
;;;;   - ensure that we work smoothly with predicting/generating more
;;;;     than one event attribute all at the same time.
