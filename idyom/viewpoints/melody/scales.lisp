;; Turkish Makams
;;
;; Makam scales are based on a set of intervals in Holdarian commas
;; (1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12-13), which define a set of tetrachords and
;; pentachords.
;;
;; Tetrachords (4 notes, 3 intervals)
;; Hicaz = [5 12 5] 
;; Ussak = [8 5 9]
;; Buselik = [9 4 9]
;;
;; Pentachords (5 notes, 4 intervals)
;; Rast = [9 8 5 9]
;; Buselik = [9 4 9 9]
;;
;; Alternative tunings mean that some notes in a scale may have
;; multiple pitches.  Some scales use different tetra/pentachords when
;; ascending and descending.  A nested list is used to represent
;; alternative pitches for a specific scale position.
;;
;; Makam scales may extend beyond a single octave, but (in theory)
;; this is not done via octave equivalency.  Instead, a single
;; "development" tetra/pentachord is specified for notes below the
;; tonic, and another for notes above the tonic+octave.
