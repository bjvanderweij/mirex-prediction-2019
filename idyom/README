The design of the system and its underlying principles are documented
in Marcus Pearce's PhD thesis "The Construction and Evaluation of
Statistical Models of Melodic Structure in Music Perception and
Composition" (2005) included here as 'thesis.pdf'. Please cite this 
thesis in any publications using this software.

v1.5
* New top-level option to specify the separator to use in output files (thanks to Peter M. C. Harrison)
* new output formatting code for greater efficiency and accuracy, fixing misidentified columns when predicting onset (thanks to Peter M. C. Harrison)
* fixed uneven splits in the creation of resampling sets (thanks to Peter M. C. Harrison)
* new top-level option to specify whether output files are written during viewpoint selection
* fix bug preventing viewpoint selection (reported by Niels Chr. Hansen and Ben Gold)
* viewpoint selection works for max-links = 1 and more than one target viewpoint (reported by Ben Gold)
* fix compilation issue with recent versions of SBCL (reported by Ben Gold, tested on SBCL 1.4.8)
* added timebase parameter in the music-objects code to allow for different timebases to be specified (thanks to Bastiaan van der Weij)
* more efficient implementation of CARTESIAN-PRODUCT (thanks to Bastiaan van der Weij) 
* new macro DEFINE-THREADED-VIEWPOINTS for flexibly creating threaded viewpoints
* new utility functions: CUMSUM, RANGE, MD5-SUM-OF-LISTS, COPY-SLOT-VALUES, INITIALISE-UNBOUND-SLOTS, SHUFFLE, ANY-DUPLICATED, RANDOM-SELECT
* midi track numbers are indexed from 1 rather than 0 (for consistency with Kern import)
* avoid negative deltast in midi import when successive notes overlap in a melody
* add random-subset argument to IDYOM-DB:COPY-DATASETS to allow copying random subsets of a specified size

2016-05-03
v1.4
* new feature: new function IDYOM-DB:COPY-DATASETS for copying and merging datasets
* new feature: new function UTILS:REMOVE-BY-POSITION in utilities
* new feature: new module for information-theoretic detection of grouping boundaries (see Pearce et al., 2010, Perception, 39, 1367-1391).
* new feature: new top-level variable in IDYOM:IDYOM to control whether existing output-files are overwritten (:overwrite nil)
* enhancement: greater randomness in the generation of resampling sets (the random state is now reset in the call to random)
* enhancement: allow the user to pass a random-state as a top-level argument to dataset-generation
* enhancement: add model configuration (STM, LTM, LTM+, BOTH or BOTH+) as a top-level argument in the generation module
* enhancement: the root and earth nodes in the PPM* module are no longer global variables
* enhancement: add a variable to control whether MIDI pitch bends affect pitch in MIDI import module (*apply-pitchbend*)
* enhancement: ignore empty compositions when importing data
* optimization: improved efficiency in generating the order-1 distribution in the PPM module (thanks to T Hedges)
* optimization: improved efficiency in generating viewpoint sequences
* optimization: generate transition counts more efficiently in the PPM module
* bug-fix: greater elegance in the viewpoint generation macros

2015-03-25
v1.3: new features and enhancements include:
* package mtp-admin renamed to idyom-db
* clearer printing of information during viewpoint selection
* add min-links to allow specifying a minimum number of constituent viewpoints in a link
* improvements to handling of voices/spines in Kern import
* ensure that phrase boundaries are correct before tied notes in Kern import
* fix last-element and penultimate-element for empty sequences
* add utility functions for permutations and rotation

2014-12-31
v1.2: small enhancements including:
* remove verbose output during data import
* linked viewpoint creation is now agnostic to order of constituent viewpoints
* user may omit trailing forward slash when specifying directories

2014-09-27:
v1.1: new features include:
* an extended and improved representation of music objects
* a time protocol for music objects
* extraction of melodies from polyphonic pieces using skyline algorithm
* some generalisation of features in the generation code
* greater efficiency in accessing music-objects from the database
* allow specialisation of viewpoints on user-defined classes
* a caching parameter to control whether LTM resampling sets are cached
* some fixes to Lilypond export (thanks to J Forth)
* installation directories are created if need be (thanks to J Forth)

2014-06-04:
v1.0: first public release, I am grateful to Jeremy Gow and 
David Lewis for their contributions to this release, and also to 
Niels Chr. Hansen and Roger Dean for user feedback.
